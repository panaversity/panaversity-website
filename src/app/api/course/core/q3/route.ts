Design thinking ensures a thorough understanding of the user and problem space, while BDD provides a structured approach to defining and validating the desired behaviours of the AI system. Together, these methodologies lead to the development of AI solutions that are not only technically robust but also highly user-centric and effective in solving real-world problems."
