We will introduce a set of principles known as prompt engineering, which will help developers to work efficiently with AI. Learn to create custom AI models and GPTs using OpenAI, Azure, and Google technologies. Use open source libraries, like Langchain, CrewAI, and LangGraph to automate repeatable, multi-step tasks and automate business processes that are typically done by a group of people."
